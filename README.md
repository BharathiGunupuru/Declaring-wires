# Declaring-wires
This project involves implementing a circuit that connects AND and OR gates using two intermediate wires. The wire feeding the NOT gate serves as the output wire, eliminating the need for a third wire. The implementation consists of four assign statements for the four signals. Check the code and waveform results to see the functionality!
